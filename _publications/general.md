excerpt: "As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, accurately representing uncertainty is crucial for enhancing their robustness and reliability. Neural networks are effective at fitting high-dimensional probability distributions but often suffer from poor calibration, leading to overconfident predictions. In the regression setting, we find that existing metrics for quantifying model calibration, such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log Likelihood (NLL), introduce bias, require parametric assumptions, and suffer from information theoretic bounds on their estimating power. We propose a new approach using conditional kernel mean embeddings to measure calibration discrepancies without these shortcomings. Preliminary experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the method's potential, with future work planned for more complex applications."
