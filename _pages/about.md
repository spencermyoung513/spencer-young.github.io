I am an applied mathematician and (Bayesian) statistician with a focus on probabilistic machine learning and computer vision. I currently work as an ML Scientist at [Delicious AI](https://www.deliciousai.com/), where I lead R&D efforts. My work has contributed to several impactful products in the retail intelligence space, including a LiDAR-based system for inventory tracking and assortment optimization, an automated shelf auditing solution, and a novel graph-based method for display-level product-price association. I'm broadly interested in statistically principled approaches to predictive modeling â€” particularly methods that improve robustness, interpretability, and decision-making under uncertainty.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my wife and son, playing the piano and organ, cooking, exploring the outdoors, and tending to my garden. As a Seattle native, I also endure a tortured existence as a lifelong Seahawks fan.
